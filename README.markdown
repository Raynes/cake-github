# cake-github

cake-github is a [cake](http://github.com/ninjudd/cake) plugin for providing an interface to the github API from your command-line.

Have you ever desired to create a new Github repository immediately after creating your project, without having to switch to your web browser and travel to github.com to do so? Desire no longer!

The plugin will provide an interface to all, or most of the API. You'll be able to create, delete, search, and modify repositories, all from your terminal with cake. And that isn't even the beginning.
